BEP-20 is not a credit reporting\r\n        agency, and it has no control over the information supplied to you by\r\n        the Bureau(s). All information is provided \"as is\" and \"where is,\" with\r\n        no promise of completeness or accuracy. BEP-20, its affiliates, agents,\r\n        and employees are not accountable to you or anyone else who makes a\r\n        decision or takes action based on the Information.

Release number </h3>\r\n      <p>\r\n        You hereby release and forever discharge BEP-20 (including its officers,\r\n        directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns) and the BEP-20\r\n        Affiliates from, and hereby waive and relinquish, all past, present, and\r\n        future claims, disputes, controversies, demands, rights, obligations,\r\n        liabilities, actions and causes of action of any kind and nature that\r\n        have arisen or arise directly or indirectly out of or that relate\r\n        directly or indirectly to the Site, the Services, your Submitted\r\n        Content, and your Submitted Content, and any\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h3>14. Governing law</h3>\r\n      <p>\r\n        These terms and conditions are regulated by and interpreted in\r\n        accordance with Florida law, and you irrevocably submit to the exclusive\r\n        jurisdiction of the courts of that State or place.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h3>15. Class action waiver and dispute resolution</h3>\r\n      <p>\r\n        You are hereby waiving your constitutional and statutory rights to go to\r\n        court and have a trial in front of a judge or a jury, opting instead for\r\n        binding arbitration to settle any claims and disputes. Arbitration\r\n        processes are often more restricted, efficient, and cost-effective than\r\n        court rules, and they are susceptible to extremely limited judicial\r\n        scrutiny. you and BEP-20 waive all rights to a jury trial in the event\r\n        of any litigation between you and BEP-20 in any state or federal court\r\n        in the event of any litigation between you and BEP-20 in any state or\r\n        federal court in the event of any litigation between you and BEP-20 in\r\n        any state or federal court in the <br></br>\r\n        Any and all disputes or disagreements between you and BEP-20 that cannot\r\n        be resolved amicably shall be decided by arbitration in accordance with\r\n        the American arbitration association's procedural rules as they are\r\n        currently published and in effect. <br></br>\r\n        You agree to be bound by the arbitrator's decision (s). In presenting\r\n        the dispute for arbitration, each party is responsible for its own costs\r\n        and expenses. This arbitration clause applies to your subsidiaries,\r\n        affiliations, employees, directors, successors, and assigns, as well as\r\n        BEP-20's subsidiaries, affiliates, employees, directors, successors, and\r\n        assigns. In all respects, the arbitrator(s)' ruling will be final and\r\n        binding, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court with\r\n        jurisdiction. The arbitrator has no power to add to, subtract from, or\r\n        alter any term of these terms, or to award punitive damages to any party\r\n        that has been damaged. <br></br>\r\n        All claims and disputes within the scope of this arbitration agreement\r\n        must be arbitrated or litigated individually, not in class, and claims\r\n        of more than one customer or user cannot be arbitrated or litigated\r\n        jointly or consolidated with those of any other customer or user.{\" \"}\r\n        <br></br>\r\n        The arbitrator's award and compliance with it, as well as all other\r\n        details of the arbitration procedure, must be kept totally secret.\r\n        Unless otherwise required by law, you agree to preserve confidentiality.\r\n        This paragraph does not preclude you or BEP-20 from sending any\r\n        information required to enforce these Terms, enforce an arbitration\r\n        judgment, or seek injunctive or equitable relief to a court of law.{\" \"}\r\n        <br></br>\r\n        Regardless of the preceding, any party may seek emergency equitable\r\n        relief in a state or federal court to maintain the status quo awaiting\r\n        arbitration. A request for interim measures will not be construed as a\r\n        renunciation of any of the Arbitration Agreement's other rights or\r\n        responsibilities.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h3>16. Complete terms</h3>\r\n      <p>\r\n        These Terms are the complete agreement between you and BEP-20 concerning\r\n        your use of the Site and/or Services. The omission of BEP-20 to exert or\r\n        enforce any right or term of these Terms does not constitute a waiver of\r\n        such right or provision. If any term of these Terms is found to be\r\n        illegal or unenforceable for any reason, the other sections of these\r\n        Terms will remain in effect, and the invalid or unenforceable provision\r\n        will be considered changed to the fullest extent permissible by law. You\r\n        may not assign, subcontract, delegate, or otherwise transfer these Terms\r\n        or your rights and responsibilities hereunder without BEP-20's prior\r\n        written agreement, and any attempted assignment, subcontract,\r\n        delegation, or transfer in violation of the above will be null and\r\n        invalid. BEP-20 is free to assign these Terms as he sees fit. Assignees\r\n        are bound by the terms and conditions set forth in these Terms.\r\n      </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default TermsConditions;\r\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
